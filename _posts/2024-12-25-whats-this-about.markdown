This is a new tech demo.

I want to give a big shout out to **[SupeRails](https://www.youtube.com/@SupeRails)** who has an interesting set of tutorials.

In this part of the demo we will be seeing what we can do GitHub hosting, Ruby and Jekyll.

1. Create the GitHub Repo
2. Install Jekyll, create the initial website and do some basic config.
3. Create an initial post.
4.
