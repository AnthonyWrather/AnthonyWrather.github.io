This is a new tech demo.

I want to give a big shout out to **[SupeRails](https://www.youtube.com/@SupeRails)** who has an interesting set of tutorials.

In this part of the demo we will be seeing what we can do GitHub hosting, Ruby and Jekyll.

1. Create the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AnthonyWrather/AnthonyWrather.github.io)
2. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), create the initial website and do some basic config.
3. Create an initial post.
4. Add [Giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus) [Better](https://giscus.app/) comments to the project.
5. Add Google Analytics and a custom GitHub action.
6. Added
